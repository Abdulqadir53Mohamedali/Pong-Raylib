# Pong-Raylib
 - First ever attempt at at using Raylib and C++ together
 - This is was done while following along with a tutorial
 - YT Tutorial channel : Programming With Nick

 - This code also contains many changes I made to fit my scenario and I myself added 2 player and a user interface ( still in the works)
 - INCOMPLETE !!
