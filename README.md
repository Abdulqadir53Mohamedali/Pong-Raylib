# Pong-Raylib
 - First ever attempt at at using Raylib and C++ together
 - This is was done while following along with a tutorial
 - YT Tutorial channel : Programming With Nick ; While I did follow along I would attempt to code it first then go back tot the video to find where i had made my erros and how I could complete it

 - This code also contains many changes I made to fit my scenario and I myself added 2 player and a user interface
